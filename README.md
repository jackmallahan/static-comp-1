## Marshawn Lynch

I created the top version of this web page to be modeled after Bradley Cooper's. This was made for Marshawn Lynch, the former Seattle Seahawk. This site was created using flexbox and media queries so that it has a responsive layout. This site is responsive so that it fits all screen sizes down to screens with a width of 320px.
